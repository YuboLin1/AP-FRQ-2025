## Question 1 Analysis
### Dog Walker

This section contains my analysis of Question 1 (Methods and Control Structures):

#### My initial approach during the exam:
- I understood the question of both parts correctly and was able to produce a valid solution.
  
#### My revised solution after review:
- I added the "company." to part A, I had forgotten that UpdateDogs and NumDogs were methods in another class therefore I needed to use "company.".
  
#### Key concepts tested in this question:
- For loops
- Boolean conditions
- Boundaries
  
#### What I learned from revisiting this problem:
- I need to watch out for methods in other classes to avoid using them without a object.
