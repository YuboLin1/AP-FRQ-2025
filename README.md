**Written by -Yubo Lin**

## Introduction

This repository contains my solutions and reflections for the AP Computer Science exam taken on 05/07/2025.

## Exam Experience

In this section, I reflect on my overall experience taking the AP Computer Science exam:

- My preparation strategy for the exam included using CSAwesome, doing practice sets on AP classroom and Albert.io.
- The most challenging aspects of the exam was fixing minor mistakes, I had the main ideas down but there might've been some minor issues that cost me a few points.
- Time management techniques that worked well for me: Reading the question first to identify what I need to find.
- Mental strategies I used when encountering difficult questions was to read what the question was asking for and plan them on a sheet of paper.

## Growth Opportunities

Through this review process, I've identified these areas for continued learning:

- Topic/Concept 1: 2D Arrays with objects.
- Topic/Concept 2: ArrayList with objects.

## Resources
Resource I found helpful during my exam preparation and review:

- [CSAwesome](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/csawesome/index.html)

## Future Goals
Moving forward, I plan to:
- Improve my logical skills in coding. 
- I intend to watch videos and do coding practices to study in future CS courses.
